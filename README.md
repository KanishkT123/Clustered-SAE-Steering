## Overview

The purpose of the branch is to find ways to detrend the clusters across layers

TODO:

Better visualization for making our lives easier & marketing
- in Gemma Anger-Calm-run, create a link to neuronpedia for each feature you can hover over in plotly
- observe, without bias, the movement of features across layers.

Detrending:
- see if we can track movement of clusters and normalize umap visualizations using that
- if we can isolate true perturbation, we may be able to read features more effectively.
